Hello! This is an AU where everyone is alive and living happily at the academy. Nikkal never locked in any love interests and spends her days hoeing around. The goal is to have sex with everyone before the end of the day. But you can ignore that and just do whatever. I don't care. I'm not your mother. Do whatever you want.

    This story contains a bunch of questionable junk, including but not limited to: bad words, unprotected sex, sex with a dragon, mentions of death, and various mentions of nasty bodily fluids. Do not do this in real life (especially the dragon thing).

    You should not take this story seriously (I don't) but if you believe I forgot something that should be on the list above, please let me know.

    [i]The Flower from Tiamat's Fire[/i] and all its characters belong to Romance Club and Your Story Interactive. I'm just borrowing them for funsies and I'm making no money from this.

    Nikkal's outfits were generated using AI. I do not approve of using AI instead of hiring an actual human artist, but since this is a personal project with zero budget I figured what the heck, it beats writing 500 words to describe clothes.

    You're welcome, and also I'm sorry.

You wake up early for a change.

Yesterday you received a message from Kingu, asking to meet this evening at your secret spot in the forest. It seems he has something important that he wants to show to you. You haven't seen Kingu in several days, ever since he left on a mysterious trip and you're curious to find out more.

In the meantime, you wonder how you can spend the time until this evening. You take a bath and then wander around your room looking for clean clothes.

There is a fresh pile of laundry in a basket near the door. You usually throw away your ruined outfits (there are always new ones available, somehow) but last week Su lectured you about wastefulness. It seems she took it upon herself to clean and mend your clothes that were stained with various combinations of mud, blood, and other bodily fluids. Fighting Anunnaki in the forest and then having celebratory sex sure does a number on your dresses.
