You knock at the door of Niall's office.

There is no answer. You wait in the corridor for a couple of minutes. The office is completely silent.

You are not sure if Niall has stepped out for a moment or if he's somewhere else entirely. Should you wait for him to come back?

    #Wait outside the office
        Niall will come back at some point, right? After all, he spends most of his day in his office.

        You wait for what feels like forever.

        It's boring.

        You're bored.

        Finally, you notice the archivist walking by. "The Warden isn't in his office today," she tells you.

    #Pick the lock
        You figure picking locks is easy. You've read in a book that you can pick a lock using a hairpin. You've never done it before, but your entire brand is being successful despite all odds to the contrary.

        You start picking the lock and after just a few seconds you hear a [i]click[/i].

        Or actually you hear a [i]snap[/i]. The pin has snapped inside the lock.

        You're bending over the lock, wondering what next, when you hear footsteps.

        The archivist is walking towards you. Quick, act natural!

                You stare at each other in silence for a long moment. Then Suen lets out a long sigh.
            #"It was like this when I got here!"
                Suen just looks at you in disapproval, clearly not convinced. She shakes her head.
            #"AAAAAAAH!"
                Your sudden scream startles the older woman. She starts saying something, then shakes her head.
        "I don't even want to know. If you're looking for the Warden, he's not here."
        *goto suen_convo
    #Go somewhere else
        No point standing around idly. Time is ticking and you have many handsome people to romance.

"Thank you, Suen" you say. "Can I ask youâ€¦"

    *hide_reuse #"Where can I find Niall?"
        *if (time > 3)
            "He left for Ur shortly after lunchtime. He'll be away for a few days. Didn't he tell you?"

            Niall probably said something to that effect, but you're so busy with your love life, it's so hard to keep track of anything else.
            *goto suen_convo
        *else
            "He's in the greenhouse, he said he wanted to catalogue some specimen before leaving on his trip to Ur."

    *hide_reuse #"Where can I find Iyar?"
        *if (time > 3)
            The archivist considers your question. "I saw him go towards the music room earlier, although I don't think he has any classes this afternoon."
            *goto suen_convo
        *else
            "Iyar? He's teaching a class this morning."

            You vaguely remember that class being on your schedule. You wonder if you should attend. You really wanted to get Iyar alone, though.
            *goto suen_convo
    *hide_reuse #"Where can I find Su?"
        Suen gives you a little frown. "I have neither the intention nor the ability to keep track of each individual student! I would hope that she's in class."

        She gives you a meaningful look, which you ignore.
        *goto suen_convo
    *hide_reuse #"Nothing. I'll be going now."
        You say goodbye and run off before Suen can find some other reason to lecture you.
