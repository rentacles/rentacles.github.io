You knock at the door of Niall's office.

*if (time > 3)
    There is no answer. You wait in the corridor for a couple of minutes. The office is completely silent.

    You are not sure if Niall has stepped out for a moment or if he's somewhere else entirely. Should you wait for him to come back?

    *choice
        #Wait outside the office
            Niall will come back at some point, right? After all, he spends most of his day in his office.

            You wait for what feels like forever.

            It's boring.

            You're bored.

            Finally, you notice the archivist walking by. She lets you know that Niall went to the greenhouse after lunch, to look at some plant specimen. Disappointed, you leave the building.
            *goto_scene landing
        #Pick the lock
            You figure picking locks is easy. You've read in a book that you can pick a lock using a hairpin. You've never done it before, but your entire brand is being successful despite all odds to the contrary.

            You start picking the lock and after just a few seconds you hear a [i]click[/i].

            Or actually you hear a [i]snap[/i]. The pin has snapped inside the lock.

            You're bending over the lock, wondering what next, when you hear footsteps.

            The archivist is walking towards you. Quick, act natural!

                #"..."
                    You stare at each other in silence for a long moment. Then Suen lets out a long sigh.
                #"It was like this when I got here!"
                    Suen just looks at you in disapproval, clearly not convinced. She shakes her head.
                #"AAAAAAAH!"
                    Your sudden scream startles the older woman. She starts saying something, then shakes her head.
            "I don't even want to know. If you're looking for the warden, he went to the greenhouse after lunch, to look at some plant specimen."

            You thank her and hightail it out of there.

    Niall is still busy with his work. "I'm sorry, Little Sparkle, I really need to finish this by today."

    It doesn't look like you'll be able to distract him again.

    You decide to go somewhere else.

    Niall is still busy with his work, but he looks up with a small smile when he sees it's you.

    His gaze is burning.

After a few moments, Niall's voice calls out. "Come in!"

You find him at his desk, bent over a pile of papers as usual. He's in the middle of writing something, but he looks up and flashes you a quick smile when he sees it's you.

"Hello, Little Sparkle," he says. "Can you give me a moment? I'm in the middle of something."

He gestures vaguely towards a chair in front of his desk.

You sit down…

*choice
    #in the chair
        You sit down and wait while Niall deals with his correspondence. After what feels like forever, but was only about three minutes, Niall puts down his pen and seals the letter in an envelope.

        He turns to you with a smile, finally taking you in.
        *goto niall_judge_clothes
    #on Niall's desk
        You sit down his desk. A couple of papers crumple under your butt.

        Niall gives you a long-suffering look and shakes his head. "Little Sparkle, I'm trying to get some work done…"

        He gently pushes you aside and carefully smoothes out the sheets of paper. His eyes linger on you.

        You wrap one arm around Niall's broad shoulders and plop down in his lap, smiling up at him. "But I'm here [i]now[/i]," you say, teasing.

        Niall does not return your smile. "Little Sparkle," he sighs, a warning note in his tone.

        He gently pushes you off. Despite himself, his eyes are drawn to you.

    "You look very beautiful today," he says.

    "Only today?" you tease him.

    He gives a quiet snort of laughter and pulls you in for a brief kiss. "You always look beautiful," he says against your lips. "Have you come to torment me? I have so much work to do today, and no time for you at all."

    "Nikkal," he says. His brows crease into a frown. "I asked you to wear more appropriate clothes for the academy. This is… extremely revealing."

    He motions with one hand in the general direction of your boobs, which are threatening to burst out of your top.

    "I thought you liked this outfit," you say.

    *if niall_disapproval = 2
        *goto niall_lecture
    
    He sighs. "I do like it," he says. "I also like to see you naked. It doesn't mean it's an appropriate look inside the academy."

    You want to tease him more, but you are afraid it might prompt another of his lectures, so you bite your tongue.

    "I'm very busy today," Niall continues. "I'm afraid I don't have time for you at all." He says the last part with some regret. His eyes keep straying towards your body.

    #offer Niall to help with his work
        Niall was not expecting you to say that. "You? Offering to do some work? Is it possible that I had a good influence on you after all…?"

        You punch him in the arm. "You make it sound like I never do anything."

        He gives you an affectionate look. "It's very kind of you to offer, Little Spark. Especially knowing how much you hate paperwork."

        "Don't be so surprised," you tell him. "I wanted to spend some time together. If I help you, you'll be done sooner, and then we can do something more fun than paperwork."

        "I…" Niall starts saying something, then falters. In a sudden movement, he pulls you close to him. He sighs. "You're just trying to distract me, aren't you?"

        You look up at him. "If I am… is it working?"

        "Most definitely," Niall says, leaning down to kiss you.
        *goto niall_sex
    #complain that his work is boring
        "Come ooon, Niall! I'm bored!" you pout. "The world isn't going to end if you step away from your office for a minute or two."

        Niall leans back in his chair and rubs his eyes with his palm. "Nikkal, you're acting like a child."

        "But…"
        *goto niall_lecture
    #tell him you want to spend more time together
        "I missed you," you tell him. "I know you're busy with your work, but it feels like it's been forever since we've been… you know… together…"

        "We did it yesterday," Niall points out. "Twice."

        You pout. "But it feels like forever!"

        Niall is trying to look stern, but you can see his resolve fading. You go in for the kill, stepping closer and pressing yourself against Niall.

        "I'll sit in a corner and keep you company while you work," you say, batting your eyelashes. "Come on, Niall, you'll hardly notice that I'm here!"

        Niall sighs and wraps one arm around your waist. "I don't think it's possible for anyone to ignore you, Little Sparkle."

        Your retort is swallowed by his kiss.
        *goto niall_sex
    #don't say anything, just start stripping
        Niall just stares at you for a moment, frozen in confusion.

        "By the…! Nikkal, what are you doing?" he exclaims. He throws a panicked look towards the door. "Stop! Anyone could walk in…"

        So much for your brilliant idea.

Niall sighs and shakes his head. "Even though we're in a relationship, it doesn't mean I can neglect my work…"

He embarks on a very familiar lecture. You've heard it hundreds of times, but sometimes you can't help yourself.

"…and it's important to preserve the decorum of the academy…"

How can someone with such a nice voice use it for such a boring lecture? What a waste!

"…I expected better from you…"

Irkalla, he's never going to stop talking.

"…will you? Nikkal? Nikkal, are you even listening to me?"

*fake_choice
    #"Oh! Uh?"
    #"Yes, Niall, I'm very sorry."
    #(mumbling) "Yes…"

Niall sighs again. "As long as you understand," he says. He glances at the abandoned papers on his desk and shakes his head. "Now you've thoroughly distracted me from work."

You consider this. 
*choice
    #"I could make it up to you…"
        "I'm not sure how to earn your forgiveness," you say. "The warden of this academy has told me in very strong terms that I can't take off my clothes in his office."
        
        Niall makes a noise halfway between a laughter and a growl. "You are without a doubt the most infuriating student I've ever had."

        "I thought I was your favorite student?"

        "One does not preclude the other."

        You step into his arms and he kisses you.

    #"I will leave you to your work."
        His never-ending lecture has killed the mood. You figure it's better to leave.

        Niall nods. "That's for the best. I'll see you later."

        He goes back to his work, and you go look for someone a little less busy.
