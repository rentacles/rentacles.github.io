    The cafeteria is full of students, as well as a few teachers, grabbing lunch.

    You look around to see if there's anyone you recognize, and immediately spot Su sitting at a table near the entrance, waving at you with enthusiasm.

    "I saved you a spot!" she calls out.

    You thank her and go grab some food.
    *goto food
*else
    There aren't many students having lunch at this hour.

    You notice Su sitting at a table near the entrance. "Hi, Nikki!" she calls to you. "You're late, is everything okay?"

    "Yeah, just been busy," you reply. You go grab some food.

What do you feel like eating?
*fake_choice
    #Lamb stew with potatoes and turnips
        Hearthy and delicious! Just the thing to keep your strength up.
    #Roast vegetables with freshly baked bread
        The bread is still warm from the oven and it smells heavenly.
    #Honey and walnut cake
        Today, you feel like indulging a little, so you skip directly to the dessert.

You sit down next to Su and dig in. You've had a busy morning and worked up quite an appetite.

*if outfit_dirty
    Su starts saying something about classes, then she pauses and takes another look at you.

    "What happened to your outfit?" she asks. "You look like you've been rolling around in a pile grass."

    You glance down at your clothes and wince. There are some very obvious grass stains and dirt stains, as well as other stains that should not be examined too closely.

    "Oh," you say. "It's nothing. I was, you know. In the garden. Doing some gardening?"

    Su narrows her eyes and leans over to sniff you.

    "By the…! Nikkal!" she hisses. "You smell like you've been [i]having sex[/i] in a pile of grass! Please tell me it's not true?"

    You'd like to tell her that, but the evidence is kind of working against you here.

        #"It didn't mean anything!"
            "I've had enough of your excuses. When you told me you loved me, I thought [i]that[/i] meant something, but clearly it doesn't!"
        #"It won't happen again!"
            "That's what you said last time, and the previous time, and… Aargh! I don't know why I believed that this time would be any different!"
        #"You're the only one I love!"
            "Then why were you screwing around with Kingu? Or is it Niall? Or Iyar?" Su throws up her hands. "You know what, I don't care."
        #Remain silent
            Despite your most fervent prayers, the earth does not open up to swallow you.

    Su pushes back her chair with a clatter and hurries out of the room.

    You don't follow her. She looked really pissed off, and this time it might take more than an apology before she will forgive you.

    It will certainly take more than an apology before she will sleep with you again.

    You finish your lunch in a somber mood.

"I didn't see you this morning in class," Su said.

You shrug. "I didn't feel like going to classes," you say around a mouthful of food.

Su lets out a sigh. "Nikki, we talked about skipping classes…"
