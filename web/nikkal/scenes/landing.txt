Time sure flies when you're busy trying to sleep with everyone you know!

Too late, you remember you made plans to meet with Kingu in the forest.

*fake_choice
  #"Maybe I'm still in time to meet him!"
    You rush off, but first you stop to change your outfit, and then you do your hair and makeup, and by the time you get to the forest it's almost dawn and Kingu isn't there. He didn't even bother to wait for you some 6 or 8 hours. Rude.
  #"It's late, I'll go to sleep."
    It's you bad you couldn't bang your favourite dragon, but it's very late and you're tired.

You head off to bed.

All in all, you had an eventful day.

*if fucked = 0
  You didn't sleep with anyone! That's a bit shocking. You can't remember another time when you didn't have any sex at all, for the entire day!
  *achieve no_sex
  *goto the_end
*else
  You fucked ${fucked} of your friends. Despite your best efforts, you didn't get to do all of them… this time.
  *goto the_end

*label the_end

Today didn't go to plan, but you're sure that tomorrow will be better.

THE END… FOR NOW
